# Beckn Protocol Server

## Introduction

### Overview

Beckn Protocol Server is a service that helps the application connect to Beckn Network. It follows the [Beckn Protocol](https://beckn.network/protocol) and makes it more accessible for the applications to get started with Beckn implementation. Any network participant can run this server and connect to Beckn Network.

### Features

- Connects a client application with the Beckn network.
- Acts as BAP Adaptor in case of Beckn Application Platform.
- Acts as BPP Adaptor in case of Beckn Provider Platform.
- Validates each request as per the Beckn Networkâ€™s Open API schema.
- Generates signatures for the outgoing requests and validates signatures for the incoming requests.
- Stores log for each process.
- Comes with key generation scripts for the Network participants.

## Architecture

![Alt text](guides/images/general-architecture.png)

There would 2 instances of Protocol Server that is running. One is `Client` facing and the other is `Network` facing.

#### In the case of BAP

`Client` facing Protocol Server manages building the context, validating the request body as per the Standard Beckn Open API schema, listens to the Message Queue, Aggregates the results in the case of Synchronous mode and forwards the results to the client side application as a webhook callback.

`Network` facing Protocol Server manages forwarding the request to the respective Participant or Beckn Gateway (BG). Also it validates the incoming requests from Participants & BG as per the Standard Beckn Open API schema and then validates the signature sent from the clients to ensure the data integrity.

#### In the case of BPP

`Client` facing Protocol Server listens to the Message Queue and forwards the request to client side application, exposes an endpoint where the client side application can send the results to the network which is again validated against the Standard Beckn Open API schema and pushed to the network facing Protocol Server.

`Network` facing Protocol Server also listens to the Message Queue and forwards the request to the respective Participant or BG. Also it validates the incoming requests from Participants & BG as per the Standard Beckn Open API schema and then validates the signature sent from the clients to ensure the data integrity.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Node.js version 16 or above
- npm version 8 or above
- MongoDB version 4.4 or above
- RabbitMQ version 3.8 or above
- Redis version 6.2 or above

(Optional)

- Docker version 20.10 or above


### Download

As the Protocol Server repository is Public, clone the repository and checkout to v2 branch.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/beckn/protocol-server.git
```

```bash
cd protocol-server
```

```bash
git checkout master
```

### Install

You can utilize Docker to deploy the MongoDB, RabbitMQ and Redis services. We've included an illustrative docker-compose file located in `docker/docker-compose.yaml`.

To set things up effortlessly, run the `setup.sh` command. This command not only copies the Follow file to your home directory but also generates a `docker_data` directory. Within this directory, you'll find the `docker-compose.yaml` file for configuring the aforementioned services.

Additionally, here's a list of files included for your reference:

 - `deploy-bap.sh`
 - `deploy-bpp.sh`
 - `dfault-bap-client.yml`
 - `dfault-bap-network.yml`
 - `dfault-bpp-client.yml`
 - `dfault-bpp-network.yml`

Feel free to explore and use these resources as needed for your setup.

Please set the user name and password as per requirement in docker-compose.yaml file inside docker_data directory. 

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

Installation of the Protocol Server consists of installing the necessary dependencies and building the project as the project is written in TypeScript.

```bash
npm i
```

```bash
npm run build
```

### Key-Pair Generation

Beckn Protocol Server comes with key generation scripts for the Network participants. You can use the scripts to generate the keys for the Network participants.

**NOTE:** To generate the key pairs, the above steps must be completed.

```bash
npm run generate-keys
```

#### Sample Output

## Configure

### Register Local BAP and BPP Networks:
- Access the [Registry URL](https://registry.becknprotocol.io/login).
- Log in using your Gmail ID.

### Create Network Participants:
- In the Registry, navigate to the admin tab and select "Network Participant."
- Click the "+" icon to create entries for both the BAP and BPP networks.
- Enter ParticipantIDs for each network, for BAP Network and BPP Network. (Note: We will call this as "subscriberIDs" going further.)

### Configure Network Roles:
- Edit the created entries for BAP and BPP networks.
- Select the "Network Role Tab."
- Choose the network domain (leave it blank for universal BAP/BPP).
- Set the Type as "BAP" for BAP network and "BPP" for BPP network.
- Enter the respective "SubscriberID" created in step [Create Network Participants](https://github.com/beckn/protocol-server/tree/devops#create-network-participants)
- Set the Status field to "subscribed."

### Set Up Local Tunneling:
- Install `localtunnel` globally using `npm install -g localtunnel`.
- Run `lt --port <BAP/BPP network port> --subdomain <any subdomain>` for both BAP and BPP networks (use the same subdomain each time for consistency).

### Update Registry URLs:
- Copy the generated URLs and paste them in the URL field on the respective network role tab in the Registry.
- Save the changes.

### Configure Participant Keys:
- In the Registry, navigate to the participant key tab for both BAP and BPP networks.
- Click the "+" icon to add a participant key entry.
- Provide a key (used as uniqueKey in default.yml).
- Copy the generated public keys in step [Key-Pair Generation](https://github.com/beckn/protocol-server/blob/master/README.md#key-pair-generation) and paste them in the "Signing Public Key" and "Encryption Public Key" fields.
- Set the Valid from date to the current date and the Valid until date to a date at least one year ahead.
- Check the "Verified" checkbox and save the entry.

    -   `url`: Populate the telemetry server URL, which accepts data in a `POST` request.
        -  Example Payload for telemetry server:
        ```json
            {
                "data": {
                    "id": "UUID",

    -   `batchCount`: No. of events to be batched before sending to telemetry server
    -   `syncInterval`: Interval in minutes to send telemetry data to telemetry server

### Run

##### Docker deployment
Update the port number inside the deploy-bap.sh and deploy-bpp.sh which you have mentioned in the default.yml file.
Execute `~/deploy-bap.sh` file to deploye the the BAP Client and Network. 

Execute `~/deploy-bpp.sh` file to deploye the the BPP Client and Network.


##### PM2 deployment

For PM2 deployment you need to git clone protocol-server four times to setup the BAP Client and Network and BPP Client and Network. Then copy `~/dfault-bap-client.yml` and `~/dfault-bap-network.yml` to config directory in respective git clone directory of BAP Client and Network. 
Also copy `~/dfault-bpp-client.yml` and `~/dfault-bpp-network.yml` to config directory in respective git clone directory of BPP Client and Network. 

After configuration, Protocol Server can be run as below.

To run the instance in Development Mode (For Debug Purposes):

```bash
npm run dev
```

To run the instance in Production Mode:

```bash
npm i -g pm2
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
```
